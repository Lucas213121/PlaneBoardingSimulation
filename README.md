Middle left contains a counter which changes the number of boarding groups in the layouts. 
The bottom left contains a save and load feature for created layouts.
Top right contains the boarding groups so the user can create their own layout. 
Middle right contains the speed at which the program runs. 
Bottom right shows the average run time, the last run time, and the run button.
